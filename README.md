## About
**wmrc** is shell utility for extending window manager capabilities using modules with dependency and error checking.

By using wmrc, you can declutter your *.profile* and window manager's configuration file, while gaining modularity and portability. If set up correctly, a single wmrc configuration can have modules which work across multiple window managers and init deamons.
